Questions
==========

Firstly, I'd like to preface this by saying that I really enjoy your videos! They've been a huge inspiration for me as a student and retro tech enthusiast! 

Second, I'm working on a project concerning the use of technology in education for my 8th grade capstone project, and I had a few questions for you. I was first going to introduce my project with a section on technology in education in the past, and continue it with a section discussing certain problems that have developed right along with modern technology. I've wanted to get some input from people who have more 'historical' insight on this area, so here goes:

1) What was the first computer you used in a school (that fits the modern definition of a personal computer) and what did it add to the learning experience?
2) Do you think that the level of use of computers and the internet in schools today is OK? If not, could you explain what you think would be best?
3) What do you see in the future for technology in education? Please be specific in terms of what certain future applications of technology hold for adding to education and schooling.

Thank you again for all the inspiration you've given me, and keep up the great work! My project has a due date for the end of next week, so it would be greatly appreciated if you would be able to respond sooner rather than later!


  Thanks,
Elliot Hosack,
8th Grade student

Greetings, Elliot!

Glad you've been enjoying LGR, and sure, I'd be happy to answer your questions.

1) The first computer I used in school was in kindergarten. There was a small computer lab featuring a trio of Apple II computers, each with their own 5.25" floppy disk drive and a connection to a single dot matrix printer. The teachers used it to teach kids like me basic computer literacy. Things like how to handle a floppy disk so as not to damage it, how to type in commands on the Apple II in order to open programs, and how to send commands to the printer to print out whatever was on the screen. Of course, all of this knowledge was obsolete pretty quickly, but it was still my absolute favorite class in kindergarten! I had never seen a personal computer before the Apple II, so realizing that such a thing existed at all seemed like magic to me. And inadvertently, it also sparked my interest in what would become the retro computing experience, which is something that formed the basis of my entire career today making LGR videos on YouTube. I know that wasn't the intention of the teachers, but I'm still grateful for the experience. Not every school was fortunate enough to have personal computers in the classroom so early on.

2) I'm not sure how much computers are used in schools these days, but I am of course all for the use of them in the classroom. Although, I'd hope that it goes beyond simply using them to do research and instead takes advantage of their potential for interactive education. So-called edutainment software is something I've been a proponent of for a long time, and I've always found it a bit sad that those types of computer software seem to have waned in popularity since the 1990s. Although I've been really happy to see that more schools than ever are offering classes for things like game programming, 3D modeling, and other creative computing skills even in middle school now. That wasn't something I saw when I was that age at all.

3) I am been quite excited to see where things like Microsoft HoloLens and the various VR/AR (virtual and augmented reality) headsets can be applied to education. Every educational program I've tried in either VR or AR has been pretty mind-blowing to me, even when it's doing something as simple as taking you on a tour through the solar system or down into the depths of the ocean. The potential is immense for taking students into a virtual or augmented world and show them things that otherwise would be impossible or cost-prohibitive. Especially for those that, like myself, tend to grasp a concept a little easier when it's showed in an interactive, visual form and you're able to manipulate it with your own hands.

Hope this helps out and best of luck on the project!

Regards,
Clint
